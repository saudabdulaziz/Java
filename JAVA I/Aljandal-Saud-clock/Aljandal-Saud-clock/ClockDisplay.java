/**
 * The ClockDisplay class implements a digital clock display for a
 * European-style 24 hour clock. The clock shows hours and minutes. The 
 * range of the clock is 00:00 (midnight) to 23:59 (one minute before 
 * midnight).
 * 
 * The clock display receives "ticks" (via the timeTick method) every minute
 * and reacts by incrementing the display. This is done in the usual clock
 * fashion: the hour increments when the minutes roll over to zero.
 * 
 * @author Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes
 * @version 2016.02.29
 * Modifications:
 * The original project was a 24 hour clock. The project has been modified to work as a 12
 * hour clock.
 * Author: Aljandal, Saud 5/8/2017.
 * constructor ClockDisplay() has been modified by adding a default time representation + changing the limit value.
 * constructor ClockDisplay(int hour, int minute) has been modified by changing the limit value.
 * method timeTick() has been modified by adding if-statements.
 * method setTime(int hour, int minute) has been modified by adding if-statement.
