/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
 *  to make it more interesting!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
 *

 * MODIFICATIONS:
 * the new scenario is that the game starts in a hotel lobby, and the user mession is to explore what is in the hotel!
 * it has 6 rooms + the main looby. The rooms are Desk, valet parking, lounge, swimming pool, vending machine room, and the hotel suites hall.
